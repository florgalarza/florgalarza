## Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Florencia 


Iâ€™m a Data Science and AI technician who really enjoys working with data to solve problems and find useful insights.  
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Data Science and doing a diploma course in Data Engineering to keep growing my skills.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on projects like:  
- ðŸ“ˆ Data analysis and visualization  
- ðŸ¤– Building machine learning models for classification  
- ðŸ§  Exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP)

I love learning new things and sharing what I discover through my projects, which are mostly in Spanish.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
